I have to admit I kind of like playing with JavaFX even though I am not expert with it.
In order to get better at it, I decided to do the [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. 

I'll try to use that learning opportunity to write blog posts about my findings.

I may not exactly follow the "1 hour a day" rule, but that's a similar idea.
I want to do 100 Days of JavaFX blogging.

Writing down my findings is a good way to:
 - share
 - writing help clarify my understanding of things
 - for future reference
