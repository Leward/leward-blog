        <div class="excerpt"><h2 id="using-nix-on-linux-mint">Using Nix on Linux Mint</h2>

<p>If you are currently happy with you package manager and installation, it is likely that you don’t need Nix (need as vital need). However, Nix will provide you with some nice additions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Atomic upgrades and rollback</li>
  <li>Multi-user package management: the packages I install or remove do not affect other users</li>
  <li>Allowing multiple versions of a package to be installed</li>
  <li>Setup of specific build environments (hello developers and Docker)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find enough benefits in those Nix features, a migration may be worthwhile.</p>

<p>Nix defines itself as a purely functional package manager. Here functional is to be understood as per the principles of <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/functional-programming">functional programming</a>. Immutability, absence of side-effect and pure functions are elements of functional programming which allows Nix to have similar properties as a package manager.</p>

<p>Upgrading to a newer version of Linux Mint, I decided to give Nix a try and write a follow-up blog post.</p>

<p>Did I absolutly need a new bike? Not neccasary… well maybe… or absolutly. I was going on a rampage by owning so far 
two Dahon folding bicycles: a red <a href="http://dahon.com/bikes/eco-c7/">Dahon Eco C7</a> and a white <a href="http://dahon.com/bikes/mu-p24/">Dahon Mu P24</a>. 
Theyre were my all round bicycles for my daily commuting in town, doing some shopping, and go a long ride, usually with a friend.</p>
